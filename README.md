textures-packet
===============

This is a very simple Libgdx project for pack many smaller images on a larger image and generate TextureRegions.
Each TextureRegion provides extra information about the packed image that is used by libgdx to load and use images.

For more information read the official documentation: [TexturePacker](https://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/TexturePacker)

### Run

Download the repository and import the proyects from Eclipse.
Then you only need add your images to _images_ directory and run the project.
The output image and the atlas file can be found in the _data_ directory.
